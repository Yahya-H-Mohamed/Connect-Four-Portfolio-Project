## How To Play

My Connect 4 game follows the same rules as the classic connect 4 board game. Two players place tokens into a 7x6 grid until one of the players stacks 4 consecutive tokens going in any direction.

In this project, the user gets the option to play with a friend (locally) or against the computer.

If the user chose to play against another player, they will have the choice to enter a name followed by the second player getting the same option. However if the user chose to compete against the computer they will enter only their name. The computer opponent is labelled "Computer.

Player (1) will always have the first turn are are assigned the token "ðŸ”µ". The second player/computer are assigned the token "ðŸ”´".

Each turn the current player is given the choice between 7 columns to place their token into. The first player to get 4 of their tokens next to each other, horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.
